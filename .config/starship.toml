# ~/.config/starship.toml
#
# A simple configuration for Starship, aiming for a close-to-default feel
# with a few high-value customizations.
#
# We will use Starship's default layout, which is a single line, and only
# override the modules below.

# --- High-Value Module Configurations ---

# 1. Directory Path: Show a truncated path instead of just the directory name.
#    The `truncation_symbol` adds a prefix to make it clear the path is shortened.
[directory]

# Git Status: Use descriptive words instead of symbols for clarity.

# 2. Prompt Character: The final symbol, indicating success/failure and vi-mode.
# This provides clear feedback on your shell's state.
