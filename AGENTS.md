# Agent Instructions

This project uses **ksmem** (Keystone Memory) for structured memory. Run `ksmem show context` to orient.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
4. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
5. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
6. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
